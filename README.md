## üéØ Key Research Findings

- **Autonomy Paradox**: High autonomy reported but moderate self-directed learning outcomes
- **Support Supremacy**: Employer support outweighs autonomy in predicting learning success
- **Business Impact**: Alumni demonstrate substantial workplace contributions
- **Tri-Sphere Model**: Integration across Academia, Workplace, and Apprentice spheres optimal

## üöÄ Complete Reproducible Workflow

### One-Command Analysis

```r
# Download complete_autonomy_analysis.R and run:
source("complete_autonomy_analysis.R")
```

**This single command:**
- ‚úÖ Reads all 4 CSV data files from this repository
- ‚úÖ Processes and standardizes all survey responses  
- ‚úÖ Calculates all manuscript statistics
- ‚úÖ Generates all publication figures
- ‚úÖ Creates all statistical tables
- ‚úÖ Produces comprehensive analysis report

### Prerequisites

**Software:** R 4.0+ (packages installed automatically)

**Data:** All required CSV files are already in this repository

## üìä What the Analysis Produces

### Manuscript Statistics
```
"[X]% of apprentices report high autonomy, yet self-directed learning 
remains moderate (M=[X]/5.0)"

"Employer support demonstrates substantially stronger relationships (r=[X]) 
compared to autonomy alone (r=[X])"

"Model R¬≤ = [X], F([X],[X]) = [X], p < 0.001"
```

### Publication Figures
- **Figure 1**: The Autonomy Paradox (distribution + learning outcomes)
- **Figure 2**: Support Supremacy (correlation forest plot)
- **Figure 3**: Business Impact Analysis (alumni contributions)

### Statistical Tables
- **Table 1**: Sample characteristics by institution and status
- **Table 2**: Descriptive statistics for all key variables
- **Table 3**: Correlation matrix for main constructs
- **Table 4**: Multiple regression predicting self-directed learning
